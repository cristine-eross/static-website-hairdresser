# static-website-hairdresser
This is a static business website that I'm building for a hairdresser friend from Targu Mures. As she had no special request, only wanted a portfolio type of website without message sending feature, I decided to stay with plain old HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. This should be a deployed project by the end of this autumn.
